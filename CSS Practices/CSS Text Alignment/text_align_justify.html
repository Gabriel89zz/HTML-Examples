<p>The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and magazines).</p>

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'

<h1>Swamp Song</h1>

<p>My warning meant nothing
You're dancing in quicksand
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee-deep and going in
You're wading knee-deep and going in</p>

<div>
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
'Cause you're a stupid and belligerent fucker
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
'Cause you're a dumb and belligerent fucker
I hope it sucks you down
Down, down, down
