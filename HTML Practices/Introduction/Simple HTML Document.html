<h1>Best Band Of Manchester</h1>
<p>The Smiths were the definitive British indie rock band of the '80s, marking the end of synth-driven new wave and the beginning of the guitar rock that dominated English rock into the '90s. Sonically, the group was indebted to the British Invasion, crafting ringing, melodic three-minute pop singles even for their album tracks. But their scope was far broader than that of a revivalist band.</p>
