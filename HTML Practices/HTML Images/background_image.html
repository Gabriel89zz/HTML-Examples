<h2>Beck Opening</h2>

<p>Hit In USA- Beat The Crussaders</p>

<p style="background-image: url('../images/beck.jpg');">
I've never dreamed before<br>
I'm gonna knock the door<br>
Into the world of perfect free<br>
(You ain't no lonely!)<br><br>
You're gonna say I'm lying<br>
I'm gonna get the chance<br>
I thought a chance is far from me<br>
(You ain't no lonely!)<br><br>

I was made to hit in America<br><br>

I've never dreamed before<br>
I'm gonna knock the door<br>
Into the world of perfect free<br>
(You ain't no lonely!)<br><br>

You're gonna say I'm fool<br>
But now I made it true<br>
How many times I try to be<br>
(You ain't no lonely!)<br><br>

I was made to hit in America<br><br>

You are the sun<br>
You are the star<br>
(To me, forever!)
